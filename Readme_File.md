In this second project I was tasked with finding a problem area in everyday life that can be solved with a mobile application. The problem area I decided to develop for was the issue of trying to easily split bills with friends. All too often I found ourselves in the situation where not everyone has Venmo or the same mobile payment method and definitely not everyone has enough cash on them, so why not make an easy to use mobile app to handle all of that. The idea is pretty simple, ideally one user would take a picture of the receipt and then the app would read the receipt, dividing up each item. The host can then invite his friends who bought things with him to the bill so they can each select things they bought. Once all items are divided up and tip/tax is added if necessary, user will be able to select which mobile payment service they prefer and pay the host via that. It is clean, quick and simple. 

### Reports
**CogTool Report**
A four-page report describing the process I went through when describing which design processes would be the best for interaction with the user. I talk about 2 main design features and the process users have to go through to use the features as well as how long it takes them to create a better application that is easier to use.

**Probe Report**
A four-page report describing the process I took when interviewing and finding informationa about our applicaiton. It goes into detail about the decisions I made, our findings, and our reflections.

### Diary Study
**Data**   
For roughly a week I tracked the spending habbits of 3 people, to find out common places they would need to split bills, what mobile services their friends use, how they are currently splitting bills and what frustrations they have with it. Then neatly laid out all our findings into an excel document.   

### Work Models
**Flow** : Direction of communication and coordination   
**Physical** : Layout of the work environment

### Affinity Diagram
Affinity Diagrams are generated during group session, organizes ideas into a hierarchy. Each observation/idea/note are hierarchically organized into themes, based on the focus of the project, built bottom-up. Put up notes from brainstorm, one by one.

### Final Presentation
A two minute long self run power point describing our final design and demonstrating the key tasks our mobile application supports.
